# Atomist - _How Teams Deliver Software_

Welcome and thank you for checking out [Atomist][atomist]! Atomist is
a development automation platform that provides developers with
timely, actionable information to speed the delivery of great
software.  See the [Atomist documentation][docs] for more information.

[docs]: http://docs.atomist.com/

This GitHub organization contains Atomist's curated project _seeds_.
A seed is a working project that can be converted into new, similar
projects via [code transformation][transform].  Although any project
can be used as a seed for new projects, the seeds in this organization
are used in various core Atomist flows and/or used by Atomist itself
to create our own new projects.
